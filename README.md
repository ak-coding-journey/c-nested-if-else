# Programming Paradigms & Concepts Using C

This repository contains practice programs and examples that demonstrate
fundamental programming paradigms and concepts using the C language.
It is designed to help learners understand:

- Basic input/output operations
- Conditional statements (if, nested if-else, switch)
- Looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays, strings, and pointers
- File handling basics
- Problem-solving through structured programming

Each program is written with clarity and accessibility in mind, making
it suitable for beginners as well as those revising core C concepts.

## Goals
- Strengthen understanding of C syntax and semantics
- Explore different programming paradigms step by step
- Provide reusable code snippets for study and practice
